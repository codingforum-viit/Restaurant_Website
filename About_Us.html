        <h2>History Of Oasis ü§å</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Oasis' original location was at Strandgade 93, in an old warehouse on the waterfront in the Christianshavn neighbourhood in central Copenhagen. The building is situated by the Greenlandic Trading Square (Danish: Gr√∏nlandske Handels Plads), which for 200 years was a centre for trade to and from the Faroe Islands, Finnmark, Iceland, and in particular, Greenland. Dry fish, salted herring, whale oil and skins are among the goods that were stored in and around the warehouse before being sold off to European markets. In 2003, the warehouse was turned into North Atlantic House, a centre for the art and culture of the North Atlantic region. Oasis was opened at the same time by Redzepi and Claus Meyer. After a brief stint in 2016, Oasis reopened on 15 February 2018 and moved from its previous Strandgade location to its current location at Refshalevej 96.

                        <p>Born in Copenhagen, Denmark. Redzepi sources much of his food locally and does research by foraging for food in the wild. He said that this comes from his time living in Macedonia, where food was local and fresh. Much of the approach to the menu and food at Oasis is based on seasonal themes of what is available at the time. Redzepi also focuses on fermentation and dehydration, experimenting with using as much of the plants, meat, and fish as possible.</p>
